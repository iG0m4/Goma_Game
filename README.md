# Goma's Game üéÆ
The idea here is to create a simple game that has the features I like most in the games I've played, learn from this project and finish it. Progress little by little with as many breaks as I need, determine what I'm going to do without too much haste and be able to learn from each feature that is implemented. 
This repository will serve to share my game, somehow use it in my portfolio and control its version.

## Objectives
1. Define the idea of the game, whether it will be an RPG, adventure, platformer, roguelike, basically the style of the game and the elements it will have as a whole; ‚úîÔ∏è
3. Taking the previous objective into account, choose whether it will be 2D or 3D; ‚úîÔ∏è
4. With that in mind, choose the game engine; ‚úîÔ∏è
5. Decide what to start studying (whether models/sprites, movement, animations) which in turn will lead to the execution in the game; ‚ùå
6. Then I'll define the next stages which will have more to do with certain actions in the game, something more concrete. ‚ùå


## What has been defined so far
**Game Engine:** Unity in 3D.

| **Game style**  |
| :-------------: |
| RPG |
| Open-World |
| Sandbox |
| Action/Fighting | 
| SinglePlayer |

### Story
A character by the name of Orick is born at home without medical help in the arms of his mother, whose name is unknown, and his father by his side. Orick is a child like all the others in the land of Scalynin who longed to reach the age when every boy began training to live a life as an adventurer. In this world, there were no social classes, but there was something similar to what we know as medieval times, where you can't be too careful. We see Orick training and maturing until he reaches the age of 17, when he finally leaves home, ready to face countless challenges. He had no idea what lay ahead - monsters, mercenaries and entire cities were after this adventurer.

## First steps
Regarding the 5th point of the **Objectives**, I will start by creating the main character, giving him movement (walking forward, backward, sideways, jumping, crouching, running, etc.) and some combat actions (normal attack, heavy attack, jumping attack, running attack and later others).
While animating the character, define the camera and its limits, when it collides and other things.
Something more abstract, but because it's not a priority for now, will be the map and menu itself.

# Conclusion
When it's finished, I intend to delve even deeper into video game development, perhaps moving on to a next game or maybe getting in touch with a team of developers like myself and starting to develop games together and then joining a GameJam.
